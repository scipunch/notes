# Introduction
Chungking Express was released in *1994*, directed by Wong Kar-Wai, and tells two love stories. It has been regarded as one of Kar-Wai's finest works, one of the best films of all time, as well as one of the best anthologies and romantic comedies ever made (where? Founded on a wiki).

# Plot Summary
There are two separate stories in the movie. The first one is about policeman *He Qiwu* (number 223), his ex *May*, and a mysterious lady involved in drugs business. The second tells about another policeman *Tony* (number 663), his girlfriend *Valerie*, and a food place worker *Faye*. The two stories do not intersect at the plot level, but connect visually.

# Analysis
## Content
Both stories are quite similar in essence. There is a guy whose girlfriend dumped him, and he meets another lady who is unique in her own way. However, number 223 and number 663 experience their breakups completely differently. *He Qiwu* behaves immaturely - gives 1 month to *May* to change her mind and spends a lot of time in calling to his familiar girls. While *Tony* acts in a more composed manner and go through his trauma independently without exposing his feelings. Also their numbers shows this. The differences don't end there - the mysterious lady and *Faye* are also distinct. The mysterious lady wears a trench coat and sunglasses, speaks several Chinese dialects and English, and is involved in serious illegal activities, resembling a character from a noir story. On the other hand, *Faye* does not stand out externally but has a unique mindset. She works at the Midnight Express food place, listens to very loud music, and moves in an unusual way. To me, she resembles a shiny cheerful person with a bright and quirky view of the world. So here we have a contrast between main characters in each story- young *He Qiwu* that calls and checks pager for most if the time & mature mysterious lady who's mostly in action and *Tony* who lives to work & *Faye* who work to live.
## Form
This is where *Chungking Express* truly shines like a diamond. I can't remember the last time I took [so many screenshots](https://x.com/suzumenobu/status/1825104569191530788) of a movie. Both parts have their own color palettes. The first story thrives on contrasts (both in plot and form) and focuses on action, while the second becomes more uniform and emphasizes atmosphere. Also there are a lot of pretty neat effect throughout the whole movie.

# Favorite scenes
## *He Qiwu* eats canned pineapples
It just looks funny. There are green peaceful background, aquarium with golden fish that illuminated with contrast ultraviolet, 30 canned pineapples in the foreground and damn biggle on the left. Probably it has some symbolism but I don't get it.

## *Faye* in the *Tony*'s aparts
When *Faye* (actress name is Faye too) spend her time in a strangers apartments her (Faye's irl) track is playing instead of default her theme (California Dreamin'). That's bright, fun and stunning (Why the music changed? Is it a reflection of changing in a character?)

# Conclusion
S tier. Should be recommended to everyone.
