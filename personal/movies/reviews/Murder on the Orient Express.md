# Introduction
Murder on the Orient Express was released in 2017. It's a second (the first one was in 1974) film adaptation of the Agatha Christie's novel of the same name. Also there are a lot of famous actors in the movie, so it definitely deserves a shot.

# Plot summary
Basic detective about the murder in the closed room. But Agatha Christie has a title of the pioneer of the detective, so probably we are dealing with the first story in the history with such a plot.

# Analysis
## Plot
The main character - Hercule Poirit. He is "probably the best detective in the world" from Belgia, strong perfectionist and fan of Charles Dickens'es stories. 
After dealing with another one crime Poirot gets in the luxury train where someone planned a murder. So detective will investigate this incident. 
The action contains pretty different characters - horny aged woman, racist german professor, wealth old woman with dogs, suspicious carpet merchant, deep christian, good doctor and others. They tell their stories naturally (during interrogation haha). But that's not enough to start empathize with them.
The script is straightforward and has 'unexpected twist in the end' which I personally didn't like. Otherwise the movie is easy and fun to watch, there are enough actions, no time skips and slow dialogues. Jokes are also good.

## Visual
The picture is juicy, contains cool shooting techniques that use small amount of space in the train. For example, long shot in the carriage corridor and shot from the top near the cabin. Work with colors is also great. The movie starts in very warm brown gamma and while we are finding out new murder details the blue tones are starting to appear. So the final twist scene consists mostly from the blue. Unfortunately there are cheap CGI in several scenes that spoils the overall impression.

## Sound
Nothing special, nothing to say

# Favorite scenes
## Poirot enters the train
Neat long shot, love them

## Murdered person was found
So all action filmed from the top ceiling. It looks pretty fresh

## The main twist
Poirot in the blue tones finished his investigation in front of the table where all the passengers are sitting (only they in brown gamma btw)

# Conclusion
Not S tier. But deserves it's time. Try to guess the murderer btw!
