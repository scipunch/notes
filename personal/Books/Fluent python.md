| 15   | Since Python 3.7, the dict type is officially “ordered,” but that only<br>means that the key insertion order is preserved. You cannot<br>rearrange the keys in a dict however you like.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30   | In general, using _ as a dummy variable is just a convention. It’s<br>just a strange but valid variable name. However, in a match/case<br>statement, _ is a wildcard that matches any value but is not bound<br>to a value. See “Pattern Matching with Sequences” on page 38. And<br>in the Python console, the result of the preceding command is<br>assigned to _ — unless the result is None. |
| 32   | But if one of<br>those references points to a mutable object, and that object is changed, then the value<br>of the tuple changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
