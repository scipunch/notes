| 15   | Since Python 3.7, the dict type is officially “ordered,” but that only<br>means that the key insertion order is preserved. You cannot<br>rearrange the keys in a dict however you like. |
| 32   | But if one of<br>those references points to a mutable object, and that object is changed, then the value<br>of the tuple changes                                                        |
