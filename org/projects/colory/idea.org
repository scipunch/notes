* App Idea: Color Learning App

** Core Functionality
*** How do users interact with the app?
- The camera will be integrated into the app, so it'll be impossible to "cheat" the colors.

*** How are the "random N colors" selected?
- The number is decided by the system. It's part of a quest to be completed by the end user.

** User Experience
*** Is there educational content on color names or their meanings?
- Yes, the app will provide info on color history, psychology, and usage in design.

*** How do users receive feedback after submitting a photo?
- Possible feedback options:
  1. **Match score**: Display a percentage based on how closely the photo matches the requested colors.
  2. **Visual comparison**: Show the selected colors alongside the user’s photo for a side-by-side comparison.
  3. **Feedback messages**: Provide encouraging or constructive feedback (e.g., “Great job! You found 3 out of 5 colors!”).
  4. **Color accuracy**: Indicate which colors were found, with a confidence level.
  - *Feedback adjustments*:
    - Accept results starting from a certain percentage (e.g., 80%).
    - Show detailed info about the actual color from the photo (name, hex code, related design usage).

** Monetization
*** What is the monetization strategy?
- Subscription that could be bought with crypto tokens. Tokens can also be used to keep "win streaks", skip some colors, and more.

*** Partnerships
- Not for now.

** Additional Considerations
*** How will the app handle different lighting conditions and photo quality?
- Will there be filters or tools to help users take better pictures (e.g., focus on color accuracy)?

*** Will there be a social or competitive aspect (e.g., leaderboards, challenges with friends)?

*** Will there be rewards for learning or finding more difficult colors (e.g., badges, levels)?

*** How will user data be handled? Any privacy concerns with camera access or photo uploads?

*** Will there be seasonal or themed challenges based on trending colors or events?

*** How will the app scale in terms of color database (will it expand as more colors are learned)?
