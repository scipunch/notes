#+author: SciPunch
#+tags: project idea

* Concept
Colory is an app designed to help users learn about colors and their names by engaging them in interactive quests. Users will use their camera to capture photos matching selected by the system colors, enhancing their awareness and knowledge of colors around them.

* Core Functionality
** User Interaction
The camera will be integrated into the app, so it'll be impossible to "cheat" the colors.

** Color Selection
The number and combination of colors is decided by the system. It's part of a quest to be completed by the end user.

* User Experience
** Educational Content
Yes, the app will provide info on color history, psychology, and usage in design.

** Feedback Mechanism
Possible feedback options:
  1. **Match score**: Display a percentage based on how closely the photo matches the requested colors.
  2. **Visual comparison**: Show the selected colors alongside the user’s photo for a side-by-side comparison.
  3. **Feedback messages**: Provide encouraging or constructive feedback (e.g., “Great job! You found 3 out of 5 colors!”).
  4. **Color accuracy**: Indicate which colors were found, with a confidence level.

*Feedback adjustments*:
  - Accept results starting from a certain percentage (e.g., 80%).
  - Show detailed info about the actual color from the photo (name, hex code, related design usage).

* Monetization
** Strategy
Subscription that could be bought with crypto tokens. Tokens can also be used to keep "win streaks", skip some colors, and send some colors from customer's quest to a friend.

** Partnerships
Not for now.

* Additional Considerations
** Handling Lighting Conditions and Photo Quality
There will be a bar that helps to find the required color. Features like changing gamma, contrast, or brightness are forbidden.

** Social and Competitive Aspects
Possible features include:
1. Leaderboards (by how many colors were scanned correctly).
2. Send your color to a friend to make their life harder.

** Rewards for Learning
It's hard to decide how difficult a given color is, so this should be discussed further.

** Data Handling and Privacy
No photo uploads; all calculations will be made on the phone.

** Seasonal or Themed Challenges
It would be great, but how to group colors by event and where to find trending ones?

** Scaling the Color Database
Ideas and options include:
  1. Integrating with existing color databases (e.g., Pantone, ColorHexa).
  2. Allowing user submissions for new colors.
  3. Partnering with design or art communities to expand the color database.
