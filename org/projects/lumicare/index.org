* Analyze current solution

** Credentials (make.com, leadtech.ru) - ?

** Research current solution [0/4]
- [ ] htmlcsstoimage.com 0h - piece of shit
- [ ] make.com - 1h
- [ ] OpenAi vision - depends on image recognition general case (screenshot or shitty png)
- [ ] leadteh.ru - 1h

** Report stuff [0/3]
- [ ] Required to rewrite and why
- [ ] What could be reused
- [ ] What could be replaced to reduce costs

* New version requirements (features, stack) [0/6]
- [ ] Increase amount of analyzed components (now 3, wanted N or all) [depends on p.2]
- [ ] Prompt and possibility to replace it with KNN - 8h (find existing solutions, analyze, test)
- [ ] Telegram Mini App - Test V0 [0/5]
  - [ ] Full description of the composition parts
  - [ ] News feed
  - [ ] Take a photo / choose from gallery
  - [ ] Chat support integration
  - [ ] Recommend skin care by skin traits
- [ ] Is it available https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments (Stripe / PayPal integration availability) - 30m
- [ ] Localization - 8h

** Stack 
- [ ] React (versel), Python
- [ ] Reasearch usage of [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencv-react][OpenCV React]] on a client side
- [ ] Probably turso could be used for the search. [[https://turso.tech/vector][Official website]]
- [ ] Find best DB pricing in RF (yandex.ru, selectel.ru, cloud.ru, etc)

* Concept design formalization
** Skin care recommendation
Is there a ready to use list of shop items or it should be parsed (how and where from)

** Persist skin type
Should we offer customers the option to choose their skin type with every request? Requires GOS-62 

** Stories
Where to get data for the stories and how to add (e.g. google sheets) 
(feature itself is huge, but I have a believe that v0 could manage by itself)

** Skin care analysis
When product should be green, yellow or red (proportion of components categories)?
Should we support bar codes as well? If yes, then shops list is required (probably it's a private info)

** Favorites
Where and how we can persist client's favorites list? Requires GOS-62 

* Minimal valuable product
** Included
- Design, that just works and looks like one from the demo
- Admin panel to manage stories ([[https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/0*IB_Ua8K7mAABvRt-.png][example]]). Stories can show only photos
  - Create/Update/Delete stories
  - Each story consists of:
    - photo
    - description (with a link to the 3d party resource)
    - schedule datetime
    - time to live (when it will be hidden)
- Localization mechanism for the app (ru only) with possibility to add other languages
- Increase analyzed components amount, replace OpenAI with a custom ML solution
- Straight forward algorithm for the skin care analysis (use simple if else method to categorize given product (green, yellow or red))
- Simple product reccomendation system (Vector search, requires labeled data product -> skin type & care concerns)
- Support chat integration (3d party ready to use service)
  
** Ignored
- Telegram bot rewrite (leadtech)
- Photo recognition improve (stay with OpenAI vision)
- Html to image convertion (htmlcsstoimage)
- Data enrichment (amount & quality). E.g. parsing shops data, additional classification of the existed dataset
- Favorites list
- Gather user actions analytics
- Remember skin type preference

** Tricky
- Make.com - We should analyze flows from it and decide, are they available for reuse & improvement or should be rewritten
- Leadteh database access - If it's impossible to query leadteh db (most probably), then we will be forced to add some logic there to check that user can access TMA'
