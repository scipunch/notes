South Korea has been catching a lot of attention lately as a tech hotspot, making it an intriguing destination for software engineers. As someone who's looking to immigrate there, I decided to do some homemade research to get a clearer picture of the job market. This isn't a big, formal study—just a personal project to help me understand what to expect.

To gather data, I turned to LinkedIn, scraping job listings using Python. For the initial data crunching, I used Nu Shell, which helped me sift through the raw information efficiently. Then, to dig deeper into the job descriptions and extract meaningful insights, I used ChatGPT for classification and feature extraction.

In this article, I’ll share what I found about the demand for software engineers in Korea, including the skills and qualifications that are in demand and some interesting trends. By combining these tools and methods, I've put together a snapshot of the current job market to help others (and myself) navigate the opportunities in this exciting field.
